CI/CD is the process of automating software development workflows and deploying better quality code frequently. Following continuous and iterative process it helps to avoid and overcome failure in codes and bugs. CI means Continuous Integration and CD means Continuous Delivery adn Deployment. In software development and operations (DevOps), CI/CD simplifies software coding, testing, and deployment by providing teams with a centralised repository for storing work and automated tools to merge and test code on a continuous basis. CI was first proposed by Gandy Booch in his 1991 method. CI is the process where frequent merging of several tiny changes into main branch of version control platform is occured by the development team members. CI enables developers to develop independently, forming their own coding "branch" to execute minor changes. As the developer develops, they can capture snapshots of the source code, generally using a versioning tool like Git. The developer may focus on new features; if an issue arises, Git can simply revert the code to its earlier state. Instead of producing code alone and publishing it to the master monthly, which may result in time-consuming bug fixes and inadequate version control, the CI/CD development approach allows teams to submit code changes regularly. On the other hand, CD is the process where development team produces programs in short period of time frequently so that it can be reliable and ready for the deployment state. Once the code has been tested and developed as part of the CI process, continuous delivery takes over during the final steps to guarantee it can be deployed to any environment at any time. With continuous delivery, the software is built so that it can be deployed to production at any time. Continuous deployment is also known as CD in the CI/CD process. After passing a sequence of specified tests, such as integration tests that examine code in a copycat environment to validate code integrity, continuous deployment automatically distributes code changes to end users. Continuous deployment allows teams to release new or updated software often and as quickly as possible.
